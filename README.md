Android Nanodegree Project - Super Duo


As part of Android NanoDegree, i'm required to improve two apps for this project based on the user feedback stated below:

	* **Alexandria** : A book list and barcode scanner app.

	* **Football Scores** : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).


<h4>User Feedback for Alexandria:</h4>

Lauren says:“I like this app generally, and the speed at which books come up on my phone after I enter the ISBN is awesome. I’m frustrated that the scanning functionality isn’t implemented yet. That would speed up the whole process and make the app way more useful for me.”
Josh says:“This app is terrible. They say you can scan books, but that functionality isn’t in the app yet. It also crashed on me when I tried to add the book my sister was reading on the flight to London.”
Hsiao-Lu says:“The app could use some work. Sometimes when I add a book and don’t double-check the ISBN, it just disappears!”

<h4>User Feedback for Football Scores:</h4>

Stefan says:“This app took me a while to figure out, but it is totally worth it! It helps me keep track of when to be glued to my TV, and keeps me up to date when I’m not.”
Moizeé says:“I have trouble navigating and understanding this app. It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."
Jennie says:“I like the functionality of this app, but I hate having to open it up every time I want to check for a new game. Can’t you put something on the home screen for us?”
